# rock-paper-scissors

This is a project to create the classic game that everyone knows by using JavaScript

My goals for this project :

- get familiar with variables & consts
- make my own functions 
- not peeking at other people's codes before trying really hard
- last but not least, to make lots of mistakes and learn from them !!

Wish me luck !!
